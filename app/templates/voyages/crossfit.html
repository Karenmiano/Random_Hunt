            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">CrossFit is a branded fitness regimen created by Greg Glassman and Lauren Jenai in 2000. It is a registered trademark of CrossFit, Inc., which was founded to enhance an individual's overall fitness and health through high-intensity and constantly varied functional movements. CrossFit's methodology is about preparing for the unexpected, making workouts broad, general, and inclusive, suitable for any committed individual, regardless of experience.</p>

            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">CrossFit offers numerous benefits, including improved physical strength, cardiovascular health, agility, and flexibility. It also provides psychological benefits such as increased endurance, stress relief, and a sense of achievement. However, due to the high-intensity nature of the workouts, there is a risk of injury, particularly for beginners or those with pre-existing conditions. It's crucial to start with guidance from certified CrossFit trainers who can ensure proper form and tailor workouts to individual capabilities.</p>
