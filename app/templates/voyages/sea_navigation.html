            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-5">The Ancient Mariners and the Stars</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">Ancient navigators looked to the night sky, learning to read the constellations to determine their latitude and the direction they were heading. The North Star, Polaris, became a beacon for those in the Northern Hemisphere, holding a fixed position in the sky. Mariners also relied on the sun, using simple instruments like the astrolabe and later the sextant to measure its angle at noon, helping them gauge their latitude.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-5">Solving the Longitude Puzzle</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">While latitude could be determined by celestial objects, longitude remained a daunting challenge, leading to countless tragedies at sea. The solution came in the form of the marine chronometer, a precise clock that allowed sailors to calculate their longitude by comparing the local noon to the time at a reference location, Greenwich, England. This invention was a turning point, making sea voyages far safer and more reliable.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-indigo-700 mb-5">The Age of Electronic Navigation</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">Today, sea navigation is supported by sophisticated software and digital charts, enabling navigators to plot courses with incredible accuracy. Electronic chart display and information systems (ECDIS) integrate GPS data with electronic navigational charts, offering real-time information on the ship's position, surrounding marine traffic, and potential hazards.</p>
